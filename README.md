## The Sparks Foundation - GRIP June'21

### Task 1 : Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours using Supervised Machine Learning.

Data : http://bit.ly/w-data

**Simple Linear Regression :

Simple Linear Regression Model is used to find the relationship between two continuous variables by fitting the best line. 
One will be the independent variable (X) and the other will be the dependent variable (y).

### Task 2 : Predict the optimum number of clusters using Unsupervised ML and represent it visually.

Data : Iris Dataset - https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

**K Means Clustering

K-means Clustering is a type of unsupervised ML algorithm which is simple and easy way to classify a given dataset to certain number of groups(clusters). Data points inside a cluster are homogeneous and heterogeneous to peer groups.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

Exploratory Data Analysis is understanding the dataset by summarizing the main characteristics and plotting them visually. It is used to gain better understanding of data aspects before creating the Machine learning Models.
